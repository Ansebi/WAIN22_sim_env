# Simulated Contextual Bandits from Recommendation Datasets
Source code for the numerical experiments presented in the paper "Simulated Contextual Bandits for Personalization Tasks from Recommendation Datasets", preprint is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10631

## Setup
* Install the requirements via
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Run the code via
```python -m main -e {evn}```
where `{env}` is one of the remmendation datasets, i.e. `e = {ml25m, imdb}`
